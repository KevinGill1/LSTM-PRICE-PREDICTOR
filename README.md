# LSTM-PRICE-PREDICTOR

This repository contains an LSTM-based financial forecasting project using MATLAB and Python.

## Project Overview
- **MATLAB:** Contains scripts for loading financial data, training an LSTM model, and evaluating performance.
- **Python:** Contains scripts for fetching financial data from yfinance and plotting time series data.

## Setup and Running
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python script to fetch and prepare data.
3. Open MATLAB and run the main script to train the model and evaluate performance.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB (with Deep Learning Toolbox)
- Python (with yfinance, pandas, matplotlib)
